  title: Digital Staff Passport API
  version: __VERSION__  # Automatically populated by `scripts/calculate_version.py` at release-time
  description: |
    ## Overview
    Use this API standard to build an API that Digital Staff Passport (DSP) can use to get NHS employee records from your system.

    DSP can then allow the employee to pass the information on to their new employer.

    The standard includes:
    - searching for an employee in the source system
    - getting employee records from the source system

    The standard currently does not include:
    - details of how security will work
    - details of the required service level for the source system
    - support for multiple organisations - it assumes the source system only holds data for a single NHS organisation
    - support for 'pagination' of search results in the event of there being more than 50 matching employees
    - the ability to update employee records in the source system
    
    ## Who can use this API standard
    You can only use this API standard if you are integrating your system with Digital Staff Passport.

    ## Status
    This API standard is a [draft](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses),
    meaning it is under development and might be subject to breaking changes.

    We are currently running a pilot with one external system and iterating the standard as we proceed.

    ## Service level
    Your API must be a bronze service, meaning it is operational and supported during business hours.

    For more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).

    ## Technology
    This API standard is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest).

    It does not conform to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir)
    global standard for health care data exchance because it is not a clinical API, it relates to workforce.
    This has been agreed with the [HL7 FHIR UK Board](https://www.hl7.org.uk/register/about-hl7-uk/management-board-members/).

    ## Network access
    Your API must be available on the internet.
    
    ## Security and authorisation
    Details to follow.

    ## Errors
    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:

    * 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action
    * 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application
    * 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server
    
    Although this is not a FHIR API, errors are returned as FHIR [OperationOutcome](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/operationoutcome.html) resources, in line with our API design guidance.

    For details of specific errors, see the 'Response' section for each operation. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.

    ## Environments and testing
    You'll need to:
    - deploy your API into an environment that we can use for integration testing
    - populate that environment with suitable test data

    ## Onboarding
    We are currently running a pilot with one external system, so the API standard is not available for anyone else to onboard just yet.

    get:
      operationId: search-for-employee
      summary: Search for an employee
      description: |
        This operation returns a list of employees that match the supplied search parameters.

        The following search parameters are supported:
        - first name
        - surname
        - date of birth

        All search parameters are optional.

        Matches on first name and surname are case insensitive.
        
        If there are no matches, the operation returns an empty array, not an error.

        If there are more than 50 matches, the operation only returns the first 50.
        There is currently no way of knowing whether there are more than 50 matches.
        In the future we might add pagination.
